Welcome to the SEAS CETS Assistant Linux Systems Administrator assessment!


BASH

Before you begin, let's verify whether or not you can access sudo on your
system. Run "sudo id" and check in with your interviewer.

Before you run bash_files_and_perms.sh, scan it and see what you can make
of the code at first glance. For each "segment" of code, determine or guess
what the output will be.

Run that script, and discuss what differs between your expectation and the
actual output.


Python

Before you run python_scripting.py, scan it and see what you can make of
the code at first glance. How many functions are defined? What are their
purposes? How would you run the script to test each accepted command line
option?

Run that script, and discuss what differs between your expectation and the
actual output.


Ansible

Show all the contents of the ansible/ subdirectory. Identify the inventory
file that defines which hosts belong to which groups. Identify the
playbook. Identify the defined role, and the two subdirectories within.

What tasks are run within the role, and what do they do?

If you were to run ansible_playbook ansible_playbook.yml, what tasks would
run on host1, and what tasks would run on host2?
